        <p>Hello!</p>
        <p>My name is Xavi, and I’ve created this website <strong>so that you can have fun</strong> every day that you’re at home.</p>
        <p>I will do my best to present you with <strong>an entertaining riddle</strong> each day. When we work together the world is a better place and that’s how we can make a long wait more fun!</p>
        <p>I have three children who are like you: they can’t go to class, but they know and understand that this is not a vacation. Some schools have given you more homework, some less, but <strong>these games can entertain you</strong> for about half an hour a day!</p>
        <p>I'm sure you have friends or siblings that could use something to do too! Please, <strong>share the fun</strong> and tell everyone you know! Only with your encouragement will I find the strength to create a new riddle every day for you!</p>
        <p>Thanks!</p>
