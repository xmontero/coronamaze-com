    title: Playing the Nintendo Switch
    history:
        text: As Laura is getting bored by the lockdown, she plays the Nintendo Switch every day for a while, either with one of her siblings (Marc or Isona) or with one of her friends (Helena, Gretchen or Ralph), but only with one at a time
        relations: No game was played in the same place, or at the same time of day. Each game session had a different duration from the others and she played with all the playmates in one by one game sessions.
        questions: Could you tell which places she played at noon and in the evening? What video game did she play with Ralph?
