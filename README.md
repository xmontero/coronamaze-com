==============

This repo is the public pages site for www.coronamaze.org

CoronaMaze is aimed to be a website to help the kids arond the world with the confinement due to the coronavirus, proposing all the kids a new challenge every day to help them keep their mind awake in a happy way during those hard times.

I am doing this with Jekyll for the automation of the creation of the static site. I'm still unsure of the final URL schema and also how the data will be structured. If you want to collaborate, contact me at xavi.coronamaze@gmail.com before forking or doing PRs.

The reason for publishing without having this for clear is to minimize the time to get published so the kids around the world can start to have fun without more delay in this new coronavirus epoch.
