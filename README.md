coronamaze.com is aimed to be a website to help the kids arond the world with the confinement due to the coronavirus, proposing all the kids a new challenge every day to help them keep their mind awake in a happy way during those hard times.

I'm still unsure if I'll edit the HTML by hand or I'll create some kind of automatic builder. So please do not fork this yet and do not do PRs until I clarify the workflow.

The reason for publishing without having this for clear is to minimize the time to get published so the kids around the world can start to have fun without more delay in this new coronavirus epoch.
